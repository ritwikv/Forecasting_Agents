## üí° Example Instructions for Agent 2

### Comparison with Drivers
```
The forecast for December-25 is higher than the forecasted drivers for that month. 
Please adjust it to be more aligned with the driver forecast.
```

### Comparison with Averages
```
The forecast for July-25 is much lower than the average of ACD Call Volume TM1 
forecast for 2025 by 35%. Please increase it accordingly.
```

### Seasonal Adjustments
```
Reduce the forecast for winter months (Dec-Feb) by 10% due to seasonal factors 
and expected lower call volumes during holidays.
```

### Business Context
```
The forecast doesn't account for the new product launch in March 2025. 
Please increase March and April forecasts by 20% to reflect expected higher call volumes.
```

## üîç Example Questions for Agent 3

### About Agent 1
- "Why is the Agent 1 forecast much higher in Dec-25 than Sep-25?"
- "What factors contributed to the forecast accuracy?"
- "Why was this forecasting method selected over others?"

### About Agent 2
- "Why does the Agent 2 forecast vary a lot from Driver Forecast?"
- "What was the impact of the human adjustments?"
- "Are the tweaks reasonable given the business context?"

### Comparative Analysis
- "Which forecast is more reliable and why?"
- "What are the key differences between the two approaches?"
- "How should we combine both forecasts for decision making?"

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### Model Configuration (`config.py`)

        "significance_threshold": 0.05,
        "min_data_points": 12
    },

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Model Loading Fails**
- Verify model file path and existence
- Check available RAM (need ~3GB free)
- Ensure CPU has sufficient cores

**Data Loading Errors**
- Verify Excel file format and column names
- Check for missing or invalid data
- Ensure minimum data points requirement

**Agent Initialization Fails**
- Check Python dependencies
- Verify model file accessibility
- Review system resource availability

**Performance Issues**
- Reduce context window if memory limited
- Adjust thread count for CPU
- Close other applications to free resources

### Performance Optimization

**For Limited RAM (<12GB)**
```python
MODEL_CONFIG["n_ctx"] = 2048
MODEL_CONFIG["n_batch"] = 128
```

**For Slower CPUs**
```python
MODEL_CONFIG["n_threads"] = 4
MODEL_CONFIG["temperature"] = 0.2  # Faster inference
```

## üìà Performance Metrics

### Typical Performance
- **Model Loading**: 10-30 seconds
- **Agent 1 Forecasting**: 30-60 seconds
- **Agent 2 Tweaking**: 15-30 seconds  
- **Agent 3 Explanation**: 20-40 seconds

### Accuracy Expectations
- **MAPE Target**: <10% for good data
- **Correlation**: >0.7 for reliable forecasts
- **Data Requirements**: 24+ points for seasonal patterns
