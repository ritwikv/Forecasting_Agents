## ðŸ’¡ Best Practices

### Data Preparation
1. **Consistent Intervals**: Use regular time intervals (monthly recommended)
2. **Complete Data**: Minimize missing values for better accuracy
3. **Relevant Drivers**: Ensure driver forecasts are meaningful predictors
4. **Historical Context**: Include sufficient history for pattern recognition

### Writing Effective Instructions (Agent 2)
1. **Be Specific**: Mention exact time periods and magnitudes
2. **Provide Context**: Explain the business reasoning
3. **Use Clear Language**: Avoid ambiguous terms
4. **Reference Comparisons**: Specify what to compare against

**Good Example:**
```
The forecast for December 2025 is 15% higher than the driver forecast for that month. 
Given the seasonal downturn typically seen in December, please reduce the December 
forecast to align more closely with the driver forecast, approximately a 12% reduction.
```

**Poor Example:**
```
December looks too high, make it lower.
```

### Asking Good Questions (Agent 3)
1. **Be Specific**: Ask about particular time periods or metrics
2. **Seek Understanding**: Focus on "why" and "how" questions
3. **Business Focus**: Frame questions in business terms
4. **Follow Up**: Build on previous answers for deeper insights

## ðŸš¨ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### "Model not found" Error
- **Check Path**: Verify the model file path in sidebar settings
- **Download Model**: Get Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct-Q4_K_M.gguf from HuggingFace
- **File Permissions**: Ensure the model file is readable
- **Common Locations**: Try placing in project root, ~/models/, or ~/Downloads/

#### "Insufficient Data" Warning
- **Add More Data**: Collect additional historical data points
- **Check Quality**: Ensure data values are valid and non-negative
- **Review Columns**: Verify exact column names match requirements
- **Consider Frequency**: Monthly data works best for most use cases

#### Slow Performance
- **Reduce Context**: Lower n_ctx in model configuration
- **Fewer Threads**: Reduce n_threads if CPU is overloaded
- **Close Applications**: Free up system memory
- **Check Resources**: Monitor CPU and memory usage

#### Agent Initialization Fails
- **Dependencies**: Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- **Python Version**: Ensure Python 3.8 or higher
- **Memory**: Verify at least 4GB free RAM
- **Restart**: Try restarting the application

### Performance Optimization

#### For Limited Resources
```python
# In config.py, adjust these settings:
MODEL_CONFIG = {
    "n_ctx": 2048,        # Reduce context window
    "n_threads": 4,       # Fewer CPU threads
    "n_batch": 128,       # Smaller batch size
    "max_tokens": 512     # Shorter responses
}
```

#### For Better Accuracy
- **More Data**: Provide 36+ historical data points
- **Quality Drivers**: Ensure driver forecasts are well-correlated
- **Regular Updates**: Refresh forecasts with new data
- **Validation**: Compare forecasts with actual outcomes

## ðŸ“ˆ Interpreting Results

### Agent 1 Metrics
- **MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error)**: Lower is better, <10% is excellent
- **Correlation**: Higher is better, >0.7 indicates strong relationship
- **Bias**: Close to 0 is ideal, indicates systematic over/under-forecasting
- **Method Selected**: The algorithm that performed best on your data

### Agent 2 Impact
